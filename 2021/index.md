While most of the research in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) focus on short-term interactions, long-term interactions require *bolder* developments and a substantial amount of resources, especially if the robots are deployed *in the wild*. The robots need to incrementally learn new concepts or abilities in a *lifelong* fashion to adapt their behaviors within new situations and personalize their interactions with users to maintain their interest and engagement. The "Lifelong Learning and Personalization in Long-Term Human-Robot Interaction (LEAP-HRI)" Workshop aims to take a *leap* from the traditional HRI approaches towards addressing the developments and challenges in these areas and create a medium for researchers to share their work in progress, present preliminary results, learn from the experience of invited researchers and discuss relevant topics. 

The workshop extends the topics covered in the "Personalization in Long-Term Human-Robot Interaction (PLOT-HRI)" Workshop at the 2019 14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and "Lifelong Learning for Long-term Human-Robot Interaction (LL4LHRI)" Workshop at the 29th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), and focuses on studies on lifelong learning and adaptivity to users, context, environment, and tasks in long-term interactions in a variety of fields (e.g., education, rehabilitation, elderly care, collaborative tasks, customer-oriented service and companion robots).
